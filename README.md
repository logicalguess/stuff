Stuff - a REST, CQRS, EventSourcing, DCI, functional example
============================================================

Doing all the things mentioned in the title is hard, requires tons of libraries, and is too complicated for most devs
to get right. Or is it? This sample app is an attempt at exploring if it's possible to do all of that while still
keeping the code reasonably simple, and with minimal amount of libraries to help out.
